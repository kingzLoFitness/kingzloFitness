// step by step of how I repo'd and put in a file or two


Created Repo for kingzLoFitness
within github.com

moving this file into the proper folder 
within homework/_websites/kingzlofitness

look into:
copy past this from .rtf (working within TextEdit)

- create link where this folder (kingzlofitness) will have a .git file from…  the terminal

enter the terminal
cd to, even if its one folder at a time and looking via the 
ls to see within the folder to get to 
final destination was this folder 
kingzlofitness

pwd to see the full path 
/Users/kingzLoOSX/documents/homework/_webSites/kingzlofitness

it stated where git is referencing (based on gitNote I forked in the repository, based on, or actually from within  FCC)????
i have to put in special for connection to git…

git init - initializes the repository in the path you’re currently referencing (dive deeper into this)
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/kingzLoOSX/Documents/HOMEWORK/.git/

replaced (but not really, just added .git into kingzlofitness) and put into:
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/kingzLoOSX/Documents/HOMEWORK/_webSites/kingzLoFitness/.git/

git add…  so now I'm about to add my uncut video to the staging area
- the thing is because it is open source file, not like a link from youTube, but the actual video I took.  I see it is taking some time to process as an example
- i wish I was able see the numbers of what being processed 
- matter of fact, reload the website link and see if it is going through processing

git add - the README.md.rtf after i take out (actually save as .md).  Looks like I have to save it under another app or what?  googling it now...  Decided to save within Sublime for now.  There is a link I need to read up on to see about loading it properly as a .md file w/ Sublime:
http://plaintext-productivity.net/2-04-how-to-set-up-sublime-text-for-markdown-editing.html

and even copy and paste this into the file from where I left off with it and make the add-on changes later# kingzloFitness
